# 👋 Hey there!  

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m **Vatsal Gajjar**, a final-year Computer Science student at Nirma University, with a strong focus on **DevOps**, **Cloud Infrastructure**, and **System Automation**.

I'm passionate about designing and deploying **scalable, secure, and production-ready infrastructure**. With hands-on experience in tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitHub Actions, I enjoy building systems that are fast to ship and resilient to scale.

## 🚀 What I Do  

- **DevOps Engineering:**  
  Automating workflows, containerizing applications, managing Kubernetes clusters (EKS), and maintaining GitOps workflows using Jenkins and ArgoCD.

- **Cloud Infrastructure:**  
  Deploying on AWS using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.  
  **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** – validating my foundation in cloud concepts, architecture, and cost management.

- **Monitoring & Observability:**  
  Implementing dashboards and alerting with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to ensure system reliability and performance.

- **Community Involvement:**  
  Contributor to **Google DevFest Ahmedabad** (2022 & 2023) and **Google Cloud Community Day 2024** — supporting tech outreach, events, and collaboration.
